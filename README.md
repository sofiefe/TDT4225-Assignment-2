This is the README for my Assignment 2 project in the TDT4225 course. 

To be able to run this project you need to download the Geolife dataset (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/geolife-gps-trajectory-dataset-user-guide/)

The values in the DBConnector.py file need to be updated to connect to your database. 

To run the project run theese commands:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python task1.py
3. python task2.py
